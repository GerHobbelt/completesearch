# We find it annoying that musicians are distributed over two different wordnet classes
# called musician. Therefore we introduce a new class, musician_0 that is a direct subclass of person.
# We move both subtrees of the two old musician classes under our new class. By using the new class as alias
# for both. Finally, we delete the old classes and will associate the different classes (creator vs performer)
# to the correct entities.

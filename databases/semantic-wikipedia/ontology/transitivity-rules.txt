# The is-a.entity.class relation is transitive.

# The located in relation should be transitive but the way it works in yago, 
# the relation just does not make too much sense. I.e. Berlin is located in germany, 
# ulm is located in baden-württemberg but baden württemberg is not located in germany.
# This is the same for ever entry. Entries on the right side never occur on the left side, too.

NEW(Hannah, 17Aug11): I created this directory and the page index.html, so that the MPII people in Saarbr√ºcken can redirect http://dblp.mpi-inf.mpg.de (and any address under it) to http://www.dblp.org/search/mpii-redirect. The reason for this redirect (instead of just killing dblp.mpi-inf.mpg.de) is that many people have bookmarked http://dblp.mpi-inf.mpg.de/... over the years and so this domain still gets about 10,000 requests every day.
